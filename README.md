My take on the player hand creation that is widely used in games like Hearthstone. This project was done before I have started the Junior Unity Programmer course.

The whole project design was heavily inspired by Hearthstone.

This is not really a game, but more of an exercise which consists of a random deck of cards, where image of every card is fetched remotely via an API. After pressing Start, the player's hand is slowly populated with cards until it reaches a number between 4 and 6. The cards are re-positioned to create a smooth animation.
